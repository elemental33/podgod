THANK YOU FOR CHOOSING [COLOR blue][B]PGTV[/B][/COLOR]!

This [B]private build is completely FREE[/B], not meant to be sold. If you paid, you have been ripped off and should ask for a refund! [B]Do not distribute this build to anyone. It is tied to your IP and will work only on your system.[/B] 
Recommended tips to make your experience better - Set up free accounts for filmon, USTVnow, Trakt, IMDB and VK.com. The android apps 0-IPTV and Caststreams need to be set up with accounts as well (These are free and completely optional).
Other useful accounts (paid) - Real Debrid, VPN(PIA), Netflix. If you're unsure what a service is... google it, I can't do everything :)
Please let the Build load up all the contents and images at first start, or you may experience some problems. 
Thanks to your support and enjoy! -PG
