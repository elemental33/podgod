THANK YOU FOR CHOOSING [COLOR blue][B]PGTV[/B][/COLOR]!

This private build is completely FREE, not meant to be sold. If you paid, you have been ripped off and should ask for a refund! Do not distribute this build to anyone. It is tied to your IP and will work only on your system. 

Some recommended tips to make your experience better - Set up free accounts for filmon, USTVnow, Trakt, IMDB and VK.com. The android apps 0-IPTV and Caststreams need to be set up with accounts as well(These are free and completely optional).
Other useful accounts (paid) - Real Debrid, VPN(PIA), Netflix
If you're unsure what a service is... google it, I can't do everything :)

I am not associated with Kodi in any way or form, this is just a custom configuration to help people enjoy the full Kodi experience. Feel free to modify it to your liking. Also, please let the Build load up all the contents and images at first start, or you may experience
some problems. Thanks to your support and enjoy!
