    <sub-title lang="en">Twiggy</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Following in the footsteps of Julie Walters, Sheridan Smith, Mary Berry and Billy Connolly, the last in the current series focuses on Twiggy. Four decades ago, Neasden-born Lesley Hornby, as she was known, found her life transformed when a reporter spotted her photo on the wall of a London hairdresser, and she was dubbed the `face of the 60s'. Suddenly the 16-year-old was catapulted into life as a supermodel, travelling the world, mixing with some of its biggest stars and eventually appearing in films such as The Boyfriend and The Blues Brothers. In the 100th episode of the genealogy show, Twiggy examines her family's past, where she discovers a history involving strong women and a hint of  crime.(n)</desc>

Dr Shah tries to find out if this condition ever occured throughout history, or is simply a by-product of modern celebrity-focused culture.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Tony Robinson and the team investigate an Iron Age hill fort in Cardiff that dominates a city housing estate, and explore whether the site could be the long-lost ancient capital of south Wales. With five acres of ground and half a mile of ramparts and ditches to examine, time is not on their side, but, helped by the local community, finds such as the remains of jewellery and drinking vessels help paint a vivid picture of domestic life around 800BC.(n)</desc>

The regiment was set up in the grounds, but today there is virtually no sign of its existence and most regimental records have been destroyed. The dig, however, is rich in finds, revealing glimpses of the lives of the thousands of men who trained at the site, many of whom died in battle.(n)</desc>

They amass 2,500 finds - their biggest-ever haul - which provide information on contemporary decorative arts, sport and much more, and also undertake a high-definition geophysics survey that generates enough data to crash the computers. The biggest surprise reveals evidence of a high level of trade with the local population, and clues as to how Britons living near the site benefited financially from the Roman presence.(n)</desc>

No one has yet been able to fully explain how these people became frozen in time, so while forensic scientists peer beneath the plaster to rebuild the faces of two victims and recreate the final moments of the townsfolk, Margaret dispels the myths surrounding the events in 79AD and explores the lives of the individuals who lived in the enigmatic city.(n)</desc>

Will and Lily see a connection between Eve going haywire and PRICE attempting to hack into Calimov two days earlier. While Lily stalls Mr Gwenlan at a PARTY event, Will goes to his house but can't get inside. Will's call for help reactivates Eve who races out to help him. Inside Mr Gwenlan's house, Eve and Will discover more about what PRICE knows.

Abe leaves hospital and is happy to forgive Eve in exchange for a new pair of trainers. Nick still can't believe that Eve caused the electric shock. And when Eve intercepts a communication between Mary and someone else - the source of the malfunction finally becomes clear.(n)</desc>

Taylor Jay admits to being slightly scared of the Victorian teacher but Archie thinks it's all a big joke. School trips aren't just about learning though. For year 7, they are a great chance to have fun out of the classroom. But for the teachers in charge, that means trying to keep order.

    <desc lang="en">As part of their series Marin, Madness and Music, Marin Alsop conducts the period instrument Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment in Brahms and Schumann. The personal tragedy of Robert Schumann's life-long mental illness drove him to attempt suicide, after which he spent the final years of his life in a mental asylum, unable even to recognise his wife, Clara. However, despite, or perhaps because of his condition, he wrote some of the greatest music of the 19th century, including the heroic 3rd symphony. Inspired by a trip with his wife to the Rhineland, the Rhenish symphony portrays some of the sights they saw, including the surging Rhine and the glowing stained glass of Cologne Cathedral. Schumann's violin concerto languished in a library with the stipulation that it should not be performed until his centenary in 1937, when it was championed by Yehudi Menuhin, among others, and tonight's soloist is the versatile, intense and compelling Patricia Kopatchinskaja. It was while Schumann was writing this that he was first introduced to Brahms, who became such an important figure in Clara's life, and the concert begins with Brahms's St Anthony variations. Presented by Petroc Trelawny and recorded last Saturday at the Royal Festival Hall, London. Brahms: Variations on a Theme by Haydn 'St Anthony Variations,' Op. 56a. Schumann: Violin Concerto in D Minor, WoO 23. Schumann: Symphony No. 3 In E Flat Op.97 'Rhenish'.

Malaby has been an influential figure in the US for almost two decades, but is perhaps lesser known in the UK. After moving to New York City from Arizona in the mid-1990s he played with Charlie Haden's Liberation Music Orchestra and Paul Motian's Electric Bebop Band, while carving out a niche of his own. Wide-ranging, free and frequently surprising, with rough-edged improv, strong melodies and punchy, tuba-driven grooves, TubaCello sees him join forces with cellist Christopher Hoffman, tuba player Dan Peck and drummer John Hollenbeck.(n)</desc>

In 1915 Ponce went into temporary self-imposed exile in Cuba. The piano works he composed there showed the influence of the music he was hearing around him - and the Cubans appreciated it. Donald Macleod also considers the close, supportive and creative relationship between Manuel and his wife Clema and recalls Ponce's first meeting with Segovia.
