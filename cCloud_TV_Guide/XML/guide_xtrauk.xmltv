Climatologist Kelly Redmond believes that the geology of the Sierra Nevada holds the key as it can create freak storms, while meteorologist Zach Tolby suggests the topography and weather combine to create unpredictable downdrafts capable of causing aircraft to fall.(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">The Eve of Destruction</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Eve is infuriated by PARTY's anti-technology messages, she apparently causes a series of strange electrical surges and Abe gets a huge shock. Nick can't detect any outside interference, so Eve concludes that for her friends' safety, she must be deactivated. Will and Lily see a connection between Eve going haywire and PRICE attempting to hack into Calimov two days earlier. While Lily stalls Mr Gwenlan at a PARTY event, Will goes to his house but can't get inside. Will's call for help reactivates Eve who races out to help him. Inside Mr Gwenlan's house, Eve and Will discover more about what PRICE knows. But when Mr Gwenlan arrives home and intends to call the police, it's what Will knows that stops Mr Gwenlan in his tracks. Abe leaves hospital and is happy to forgive Eve in exchange for a new pair of trainers. Nick still can't believe that Eve caused the electric shock. And when Eve intercepts a communication between Mary and someone else - the source of the malfunction finally becomes clear.(n)</desc>
