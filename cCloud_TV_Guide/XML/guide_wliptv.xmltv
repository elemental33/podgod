    <desc lang="en">Part two of two. The documentary examines the key role played by royalty in smoothing the path to the Anglo-Russian entente of 1907, and the part played by the Kaiser's erratic, unstable personality in the growing isolation of Germany in the years leading up to 1914. The film also explores the roles played by the German, British and Russian monarchs in the months leading up to the outbreak of the First World War and tells the story of George V's refusal to grant his cousin Nicholas II asylum in England following the Russian Revolution of 1917.(n)</desc>

The price of copper and precious metal has reached such levels that 500 metres of cable is worth about £50,000 - so these days, when the lights go out on the motorway, it isn't necessarily a cost-cutting exercise or a fault. More often than not, it's because a group of organised metal thieves has struck. Jamie Theakston narrates.(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">The Eve of Destruction</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Eve is infuriated by PARTY's anti-technology messages, she apparently causes a series of strange electrical surges and Abe gets a huge shock. Nick can't detect any outside interference, so Eve concludes that for her friends' safety, she must be deactivated. Will and Lily see a connection between Eve going haywire and PRICE attempting to hack into Calimov two days earlier. While Lily stalls Mr Gwenlan at a PARTY event, Will goes to his house but can't get inside. Will's call for help reactivates Eve who races out to help him. Inside Mr Gwenlan's house, Eve and Will discover more about what PRICE knows. But when Mr Gwenlan arrives home and intends to call the police, it's what Will knows that stops Mr Gwenlan in his tracks. Abe leaves hospital and is happy to forgive Eve in exchange for a new pair of trainers. Nick still can't believe that Eve caused the electric shock. And when Eve intercepts a communication between Mary and someone else - the source of the malfunction finally becomes clear.(n)</desc>

The kids are gutted, but determined that their own friendships will survive. Their efforts to stay in touch bring Dad and Amber into contact - and their frosty relationship starts to thaw. But it gets stuck in the worst possible place: the dreaded Friendzone. Getting them past that is the kids' biggest challenge yet. Mum has problems of her own when she decides slacker Craig needs a hobby. It's a good idea - but she soon regrets it when he takes up the drums.(n)</desc>

Taylor Jay admits to being slightly scared of the Victorian teacher but Archie thinks it's all a big joke. School trips aren't just about learning though. For year 7, they are a great chance to have fun out of the classroom. But for the teachers in charge, that means trying to keep order.
